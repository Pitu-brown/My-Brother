In typical QSAR, the properties of the target is neglected total from the anaysis. With the advent of the genomics revolutation, things have changed radically. One of the issues in drug design is that some targets undergoes mutational changes, whcih can be seen in the resistance in antibiotics and antivral compounds. During the treatment mutations may occur in the gene of the pathogen, which may induce its resistant to the tratment. Because of the evolutationary pressure that mutant forms that are most viable under the tratment. And also for drug resistnace during treatments of cancer. Development of drug resistnace is a problem in drug development, with the mutations constantly change the structural properties of the drug targets. The chemist is then forced to develop new drugs that interact efficiently with the new mutated targets.

Proteochemometrics (PCM) allows to to analyze virtually any number of targets and mutant variants simultaneously.
