When there is a crystal structure or a high-quality homology model (verified via PROCHECK or others softwares) is available for the target, it is possible to performed molecular docking. The crystal structure can be utilized in several ways. One of the ways is to investigate how a molecules might be modified to improve its potency, selectivity and ADME properties. Generally, docking consists of two parts, which are sampling and scoring. In the sampling part, the ligand is docked into the protein cavity in many different ways using different conformations of the ligand. Ligand conformation refers to the same chemical composition but having different bond-angles. Ligand orientation is different from conformation in a way that the bond angles are the same between multiple ligands but the orientation (transition, global rotation) is different. Ligand pose is the binding-mode of a ligand in a protein binding site, which considered a combination of orientation and conformations. Generally, a ligand can act as a receptor agonist-a molecule that triggers a response or as a antagonist, a molecule that suppress the activity of the receptor.


Once the ligand is docked, The docking poses are scored. The scoring is an estimate of the free energy binding interaction between the ligand and the protein. A specific scoring function is utilized for scoring the free energy of the interaction.
