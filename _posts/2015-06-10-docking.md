When there is a crystal structure or a high-quality homology model (verified via PROCHECK or others softwares) is available for the target, it is possible to performed molecular docking. The crystal structure can be utilized in several ways. One of the ways is to investigate how a molecules might be modified to improve its potency, selectivity and ADME properties.
